{"name":"Dockchains","tagline":"Draft","body":"# Dockchains - RFC\r\n\r\n>>This is a first dump and draft\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nDocker containerisation is quickly becoming the preferred de facto software delivery mechanism and for the first time in the history of mankind emerging Blockchain technologies are progressing towards acceptance as universally undisputed public transaction ledgers, not requiring trust in any one individual or organisation (but to some extent in the improbablity of collusion).\r\n\r\n>> Note: The implementation ideas below are highly preliminary, more of a collection of possibly relevant technologies and projects to be inspired by.\r\n\r\nWhile the problems and solutions outlined below are universal we believe that the right place to start is in among the alpha geeks in the developer community. The emerging design patterns and templates can serve as a foundation, i.e a platform for other verticals until we have pushed these technologies into the internet protocol stack.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nIf you subscribe to the belief that \"Things\" are better and more economically served by general purpose SoCs (System on Chip) rather than custom designed circuitry it is not far-fetched to believe that Dockers will soon break the confines of the data center cloud and spread as fog to the edges. In any case, we will soon be facing some of the following challenges:\r\n\r\n- scalability\r\n  - high bandwidth costs\r\n  - reliance on a single centralized point of failure\r\n  - centralized authority\r\n- data integrity and security\r\n  - authenticity\r\n  - publisher verification, reputation\r\n  - tamper resistance and evidence\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nWe propose the establishment of a fully distributed Open Docker Store as a Public Good.\r\n\r\nIt should be\r\n\r\n* owned by nobody\r\n* available to everybody\r\n* self-organizing\r\n* handling open, closed and everything in-between\r\n\r\nand provide\r\n\r\n- a searchable index of pre-built binary docker containers\r\n- an auditable and deterministic build process\r\n- anti-fragility by design (battle hardened containers will float to the top)\r\n- a publisher identity system\r\n- metrics (reputation scores, crash analytics)\r\n- a social layer (contextual issues and crowd source help)\r\n\r\nNote: All meta data would of course also be maintained according to Named Data Networking principles.\r\n\r\nNote: To simplify things (and not require container consumers to have to participate in the financial aspects of cryptocurrency), we will initially limit ourselves to many-to-many distribution of almost *free* pre-packaged containers. Almost since you would still transact processing costs among the nodes. They are however free as in FOSS. Most importantly this means that we limit the attack surface of the ecosystem (since consumers end up needing to hold actual crypto currency, at least it should be in very limited amounts) and the attackers ROI.\r\n\r\n## Implementation Ideas\r\n\r\n### Distributed Autonomous Corporation\r\n\r\nNote: Not only decentralized but *distributed*, the distinction will be explained below.\r\n\r\nStan Larimer of Invictus Corporation is one of the foremost proponents of the revival of Nick Szabos ideas and captures their defining qualities as\r\n\r\n- They are corporations – they are free and independent persons (but don’t have legal personality).\r\n- They are autonomous – once up to speed, they no longer need (or heed) their creators.\r\n- They are distributed – there are no central points of control or failure that can be attacked.\r\n- They are transparent – their books and business rules are auditable by all.\r\n- They are confidential – customer information is securely (and incorruptibly) protected.\r\n- They are trustworthy – because no interaction with them depends on trust.\r\n- They are fiduciaries – acting solely in their customers’ and shareholders’ interests.\r\n- They are self-regulating – they robotically obey their own rules.\r\n- They are incorruptible – no one can exercise seductive or coercive influence over them.\r\n- They are sovereign – over their digital resources (but don't have legal capacity).[5]\r\n\r\n### Identity\r\n\r\nBefore entering into smart contracts as peers we need to establish an identity system on which to base them. Identity is just metadata and does not apply only to people but organizations and any data. Several interesting initiatives based on crypto and different degrees of decentralization have been proposed:  \r\n\r\n- tbd\r\n- tbd\r\n- Chris Ellis - The World Citizenship project [5](#ref5)\r\n\r\n### Smart Contracts \r\n\r\nRead more - [3](#ref3)\r\nAs noted above, our Docker Store works and operates should be enscribed in public and fully transparent Smart Contracts.  \r\n\r\nNote: Smart Contracts are just as efficient as digital [Panopticon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon) mechanisms - the mere knowledge of their existance and self-enforcing rules leads to compliance. \r\n\r\n### Ledgers\r\n\r\nThe crypto community is abuzz with competing proposals for side chains and tree chains ([[1]](#ref1) to remedy the inherent scalability issues of Bitcoin. Docker containers are simple digital assets like any other so we can take full advantage of the community solutions. We distinguish between different types of ledgers by the access rights assigned to them:\r\n\r\n### Public Ledger\r\n\r\nMedium term, the only stable blockchain seems to be Bitcoin why we propose a protocol built on top of Bitcoin for the Public Ledger:\r\n\r\n- Counterparty - http://counterparty.io\r\n- MasterCoin - http://www.mastercoin.org\r\n- Coloured Coins - http://coloredcoins.org\r\n  - ChromaWallet - http://chromawallet.com\r\n  - Coinprism - https://www.coinprism.com\r\n  - Iridis - https://github.com/owlen/iridis\r\n\r\n### Private Ledgers\r\n\r\nA certain organization, cloud provider would for obvious reasons prefer to keep their metadata private. What is important is that protocols are the same and open.\r\n\r\n### Protected (Shared) Ledgers\r\n\r\nOnce an anomaly of some sort has been detected, previously private ledgers can be selectively made available (by a contract or a multisig escrow mechanism) to a closed group of aribtrators, insurers or even made public. \r\n\r\n### Wallet\r\n\r\nDocker publishers will have to maintain their Docker Assets in a Wallet suitable for the protocol chosen.\r\n\r\nA non-exhaustive list (suggestions appreciated):\r\n\r\n- Counterwallet - https://counterwallet.io\r\n- ChromaWallet - http://chromawallet.com\r\n- other\r\n\r\n### Content Distribution\r\n\r\nBitTorrent is as natural a choice for binary images as is git for source.\r\n\r\n### Source Code Repository\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons github.com is the sole contender here, at least as an aggregating hub. To simplify the design we might even have to trust them ;-) \r\n\r\nThe unfortunately abandoned project https://github.com/gitchain/gitchain shares many of the same design goals as Project Dockchains. We should study and learn from the experiences made there and hopefully get the developer to join forces with us.\r\n\r\n### Deterministic Build Process\r\n\r\nThe Codius Smart Contracts project is already developing Oracle technology based on \r\n\r\n- Google Native Client - https://code.google.com/p/nativeclient/\r\n- Gitian - https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder\r\n\r\nWe share the same need for a highly trusted build process so let’s join forces with them and make sure our Docker Build use case is provided for.\r\n\r\n## Participate/Contribute\r\n\r\nThe first thing to slap into shape is this very document. Pull requests are eagerly requested.\r\n\r\n### Stay in sync\r\n\r\nFork this repo, clone the fork, and add the original repo as a remote called `upstream`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/username/dockchains.github.io.git\r\n$ cd dockchains.github.io\r\n$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/dockchains/dockchains.github.io.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nPull from `upstream` frequently to keep your local copy up to date:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git pull upstream \r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you might need to merge conflicting local changes. If you are IDE less:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git mergetool\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pull request\r\n\r\nBest explained [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)\r\n\r\n### Dev Process\r\n\r\nWe will manage the backlog as plain and simple [issues](https://github.com/dockchains/dockchains.github.io/issues) in combination with the [wiki](https://github.com/dockchains/dockchains.github.io/wiki).\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ref1\">[1]</a> TreeChains, Peter Todd  - [Bitcoin-development mailing list post](http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg04388.html)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ref2\">[2]</a> Codius Smart Contracts, Ripple Labs - [Project page](http://codius.org)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ref3\">[3]</a> The Idea of Smart Contracts, Nick Szabo - [Blog post](http://szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_idea.html)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ref4\">[4]</a> DAOs, DACs, DAs and More: An Incomplete Terminology Guide, Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum.org [Blog post](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/05/06/daos-dacs-das-and-more-an-incomplete-terminology-guide/)\r\n\r\n<a name=\"ref5\">[5]</a> World Citizenship, Chris Ellis - [Github repo](https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 [Rebaser AB](http://www.rebaser.com).
